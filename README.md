# Absenteeism Case Study
This repository contains a case study on predicting employee absenteeism using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, data visualization, and building a logistic regression model to classify excessive absenteeism.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about employee absenteeism, including reasons for absence, transportation expenses, distance to work, age, daily work load, body mass index, education, children, pets, and the absenteeism time in hours.
